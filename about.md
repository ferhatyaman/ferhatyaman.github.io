<p>This is Ferhat. I am 25 years old, from Raleigh, North Carolina. I am doing Ph.D. on Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University. It can seem that I am much like a tech guy, actually not at all. Yeah, those new technology and researches make me excited and I want to be part of it. On the other hand, meeting with new people and listening to their stories and cultures are also pleasant to me.</p>

<p>I always try to combine my desires and dreams with my job. Because of that purpose, I was traveling around the world when I did an exchange semester in Hong Kong, an internship in Boston and another internship in Croatia. Lastly, I have been in Singapore for almost 3 months to research deep learning protocols on encrypted data. I have accumulated some stories and experience from my travels, internships, and studies. I will be posting those in here.</p>

<p>My main purpose in academia is pursuing a Ph.D. degree in the system and network security. I want to pursue a specialization in that problem while having a broad knowledge and understanding. To realize that for me, I have conducted several research projects at Sabanci University, Boston University and the Agency of Science, Technology, and Research.</p>

<p>Apart from those investments for me, I have very big concerns education in Turkey. I want to be of teaching sessions and I was trying to take an active role against this problem. Therefore, I was tutoring 2 high school student after graduating from high school. After taking some courses at university, I was doing a teaching assistantship for those courses. After struggling by myself, I want to be part of big educational organizations. I have started mentoring at <a href="https://kesisenyollar.org/en/">Crossing Paths</a> for university students who try to find their career path. Someone who already past that path can give useful pieces of advice to people. Some of my friends helped me a lot, now it is my turn. I am also part of another organization called <a href="https://degistirenadimlar.org/">Changing Steps</a> which aims to gain social involvement and leadership skills for university students. I am also using my technology skills to help this organization as an IT Consultant. One day, I may help, advise, teach my students or mentees as Professor. </p>
